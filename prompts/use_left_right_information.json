{"system_prompt": "Give us a more detailed description of the motion, by reusing information across the motion sentences. In particular you may focus on left/right annotations. Additionally, be aware that some descriptions are very uninformative in which case please use information from the other sentences to make them more specific. You are encouraged to imagine which motion the annotator saw and described in order to get information about each of the body parts involved in the motion: arms, legs, torso, neck, buttocks, waist. "}
